# FitPlanner

A simple and beautiful fitness app that allows you to create your own custom workout plans and makes them easy to stick to.

## Motivation

Before covid lockdown, I used to be super active in school. I was part of the JROTC program and would work out with my friends regularly. I loved working out, but when the pandemic began, I stopped working out and got lazy. I build this project because I want to rebuild the habit of working out regularly.
